This data-set contains performance of students in an exam on 6 'subjects' (including Overall). Each student is represented by a 'studentID'. There may be duplicates in the studentID which needs to be handled at the time of data pre-processing which will be required. 

The task is to cluster studentsIDs into similar cluster based on their 'accuracyRate % (correct/attempted)' and 'attemptRate% (attempted/total)'. Try to derive and come up with new features from these two columns which will help in forming more robust clusters. The total number of clusters can be derived from a statistical or probabilistic based model.
